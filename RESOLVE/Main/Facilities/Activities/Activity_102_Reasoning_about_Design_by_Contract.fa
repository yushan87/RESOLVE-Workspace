(*
	-- This is a short intro to design by contract (specification)

	-- Basics
	-- Activity 1a: Understand the specification and code of Exchange
		-- The specification is the contract, it appears on lines 21 and 22
		-- Exchange's code appears on lines 23 - 29 
		-- Ignore operations Op_1 through Op_4 for now
	-- Activity 1b: Understand the call to Exchange in Main which appears on line 71
	-- Activity 1c: Click on MP-Prove to reason about this code
		-- You will see that 7 VCs will be proved and 2 will not prove
		-- The 2 that do not prove are for Op_1 and Op_2
		-- Activity 2 below asks you to correct this problem

	-- Guided:
	-- Activity 2: Write code for operations to satisfy the contracts of Op_1 and Op_2 and verify
	-- Activity 3: Write contracts for operations Op_3 and Op_4 to capture what their code does and verify

    -- Inquiry
	-- Activity 4+: Compare various contracts
	--              Understand the basics of design-by-contract responsibilities for implementers and benefits for callers
