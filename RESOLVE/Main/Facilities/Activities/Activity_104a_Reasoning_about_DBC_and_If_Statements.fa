	-- Basic
	-- This activity combines the ideas of design by contract and if statements
	-- In this actitivity, Main is implemented so that it calls Reorder to determine the maximum and minimum values 
	-- Activity 1a: To understand Reorder, examine its specification and implementation
	-- Activity 1b: To understand Main, examine its implementation, pay close attention to the call to Reorder

	-- Guided
	-- Activity 2: In operation Reorder, eliminate the use of the swap statement and then insert code that uses a 
	-- 			   temporary variable and assignment statements to correctly swap the values in I and J.

	-- Activity 3a: Uncomment Reorder_2 by deleting the (* and *) that appear before and after the operation. At this time leave Reorder_2's requires clause as a comment.
	-- Activity 3b: Attempt to verify Reorder_2 by clicking the MP-Prove button.
	--				After verifying, notice that 2 VCs fail to prove for the line in Reorder_2 that contains the "If"
	--				These 2 VCs have to do with showing that evaluating I - J does not produce Integer underflow or overflow.
	-- Activity 3c: Also uncomment the requires clause of Reorder_2 and attempt to verify it

	-- Hard Activity 4+: Rewrite the contract of (ensures clause of) Reorder without using max or min
