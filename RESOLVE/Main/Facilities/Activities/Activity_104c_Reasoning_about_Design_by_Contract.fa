	-- This is a short intro to design by contract (specification)
    
	-- Basics
	-- Activity 1a: Understand each specification given
	-- Activity 1b: Click on MP-Prove to reason about this code
        
	-- Guided:

	-- Activity 2a: Remove the requires clause of Do_Nothing_1 and attempt to prove; explain
	-- Activity 2b: Reinsert the removed requires clause; Remove an assignment statement in Do_Nothing_1 and attempt to prove; explain
	-- Activity 2c: Fix up Do_Nothing_1 back to what it was

	-- Activity 3a: Uncomment call to Do_Nothing in Main and attempt to prove
	-- Activity 3a: Uncomment call to Do_Nothing_1 in Main and attempt to prove; explain
	-- Activity 3c: Uncomment call the if statement in Main and attempt to prove; explain

	-- Activity 4a: Change only the code for Do_Nothing_2 so it verifies
	-- Activity 4b: Uncomment call to Do_Nothing_2 in Main and attempt to prove; explain

	-- Inquiry
	-- Activity 5+: Compare various specifications of Do_Nothing; 
	--              Understand design-by-contract responsibilities of implementers of operations and callers
