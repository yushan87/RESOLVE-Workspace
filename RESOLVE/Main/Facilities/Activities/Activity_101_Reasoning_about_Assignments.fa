	-- This is a short intro to logical reasoning through activities

	-- Basics
	-- Activity 1a: Click on MP-Prove to reason about this code
	-- Activity 1b: Click on build, generate jar, and execute this code

	-- Guided
	-- Activity 2a: Uncomment Rememember and Confirm assertions by removing -- and MP-Prove (prove)
	-- Activity 2b: Write a new Confirm assertion about the value of K that is true -- and prove
	-- Activity 2c: Write a Confirm assertion about the value of K that is false -- and attempt to prove

	-- Inquiry
	-- Activity 3+: Explore assignment statements (e.g., add or remove) and confirm assertions in various ways
