	-- This is a short intro to logical reasoning through activities

	-- Basics
	-- Activity 1: Click on MP-Prove to reason about this code

	-- Guided
	-- Activity 2a: Uncomment Rememember and Confirm statement by removing -- and prove
	-- Activity 2b: Change Confirm statements in various ways (e.g., I = #I) and attempt to prove

	-- Inquiry
	-- Activity 3+: Introduce new variables and explore combinations of swap statements
	-- Activity 3+: Compare assignment statements and swap statements
