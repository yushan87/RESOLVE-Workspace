	-- Swap operator is efficient for all data types and facilitates ease of reasoning

	-- Basics
	-- Activity 1: Click on MP-Prove to reason about this code

	-- Guided
	-- Activity 2a: Uncomment Remember and Confirm statements by removing -- and prove
	-- Activity 2b: Change Confirm statements in various ways (e.g., I = #I) and attempt to prove
	
	-- Inquiry
	-- Activity 3+: Introduce new variables and explore combinations of swap statements
	-- Activity 4+: Compare assignment statements and swap statements
